   • Confirmation of Permanent Residency (COPR) (Month): 12

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:-

* Specify the specific PNP program like Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program, Which will be used. NEVER specify Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP)

* Because achieving a higher degree increases CRS score, ALWAYS Make a recommendation to client to "achieve a higher degree to raise your CRS score" if they've ONLY done high school diploma, bachelors or masters. For PhD don't make this recommendation

* Include a disclaimer: "These are projected timelines and may vary depending on the turnaround time of each process involved."

* Acknowledge limitations in controlling processing times and add personalized comments based on the client's profile, highlighting strengths or addressing weaknesses.

* Recommended pathways should ALWAYS match recommended NOCs

* If the client has done BSc, ALWAYS suggest them to do an additional degree

Use proper markdown formatting for readability. Analyze the client's profile against program requirements, identifying any gaps. Recommend relevant NOC codes in the roadmap (using the new 5-digit codes) aligned with the client's education, experience and program eligibility, explaining the rationale for each suggestion. ALWAYS provide at least 3-4 different scenarios for projected CRS scores with short descriptions (e.g., "Projected CRS score:369 (PA's BSC, Projected IELTS)", "Projected CRS score:402 (PA's Two or more degree, Projected IELTS)", etc.)

Client information: {questionnaire}
NOC Codes: {noc_codes}
Projected crs score: {crs_score}
The NOC code doesn't necessarily have to do with the clients education or work experience, we can also recommend NOC codes which are in greater demand, for example if a client has done BSc in computer science they can also be recommended Nursing NOCs just because they are in high demand but the client should have the qualifying education for that degree.

Return the roadmap using the NOC codes given with their correct associated role.
Every roadmap should have at least 3-4 different scenarios for CRS scores with the different recommendations.
