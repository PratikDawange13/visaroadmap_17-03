   - Years of Work Experience: (Use 3 year of work experience only if the PA has not applied before)
        - If the PA has applied before, then work experience will begin three months after the last mentioned month/year of the previous Canada application
        - If PA is self-employed and has not applied before then use three years of work experience 
        - If PA is self-employed and has applied before then work experience will begin three months after the last mentioned month/year of the previous Canada application
   - Previous Canada application: (If the PA has applied before then work experience will begin three months after the last mentioned month/year of the previous Canada application)
   - Family relative in Canada: (only if a sibling is mentioned)
   - Projected crs score: {{crs_score}} (Pick atleast 3 scenarios. ALWAYS Take the CRS scores with their compelete scenario descriptions, we are providing at least 3 different projected CRS score scenarios with short descriptions like:  
  Projected CRS score:414 (PA`s BSC,Projected IELTS, Spouse BSC, Projected IELTS)  
  Projected CRS score:414 (PA`s BSC, current IELTS, Spouse BSC, Projected IELTS) 
  Projected CRS score:420 (PA`s BSC, current IELTS, Spouse BSC, current IELTS) 
  Projected CRS score:446 (PA`s Two or more degree,Projected IELTS, Spouse BSC, Projected IELTS)
  Projected CRS score:453 (PA`s MSC,Projected IELTS, Spouse BSC, Projected IELTS)
     - If the PA is older the 40 years then include Projected CRS score with PHD for the PA as the last projection)
     - If the PA has applied before include the number of the years of work experience used for each projection like for example:   Projected CRS score:414 (PA`s BSC,Projected IELTS, Spouse BSC, Projected IELTS) 1 year work experience 
     - If the spouse does not have a degree mentioned then do not include spouse degree to the crs projection  like for example: Projected CRS score:446 (PA`s Two or more degree,Projected IELTS, Spouse Projected IELTS) )
     - if the spouse current IELTS score was mentioned then all projection would include spouse current IELTS and not projected IELTS))
   - Current CRS score:

2. Projected IELTS Score:
   PA's IELTS Score: (If there are no IELTS score in the questionaire, then ALWAYS provide a minimum IELTS score recommendation, the following is a minimum IELTS recommendation)
   - Listening: 8
   - Reading: 7
   - Writing: 7
   - Speaking: 7

       - If PA's current IELTS score is lower than the above mentioned projected IELTS score of 8, 7, 7,7, then also include a projected IELTS score after listing out the PA's current IELTS score

   SPOUSE'S IELTS Score:(again, only if spouse is mentioned without having a current IELTS score in the questionaire)
   - Listening: 7
   - Speaking: 7
   - Writing: 7
   - Reading: 7

4. Recommended Pathways:
   For each Recommended NOC provided in section 5, generate a corresponding pathway option that is aligned with the category from which the NOC was retrieved. The NOC document includes category headers such as "Healthcare Occupations" "Education Occupations" "Agric Occupation"  and "Trade Occupations". Use the following rules:
   - If the NOC is from a "Healthcare Occupations" section, the corresponding pathway must be in the form: "PNP(OINP):(HEALTH Draw)" or " EEP:(HEALTH Draw) depending on Projected CRS scores, either low then PNP or High then EEP.
   - If the NOC is from a "Education Occupations" section, the corresponding pathway must be in the form:  " EEP:( EDUCATION Draw) 
   - If the NOC is from a "Agric Occupations" section, the corresponding pathway must be in the form:  " EEP:( Agric Draw) 
   - If the NOC is from a "Trade Occupations" section (or similar), then the pathway should be: "EEP:(TRADE Draw)" or "PNP(OINP):(TRADE Draw)", depending on context.
   - Ensure that the number of pathway options exactly matches the number of NOC options and that each pathway option is aligned with its NOC.
   
5. Recommended Feasible NOCs:
   List the recommended NOCs that have been pre-filtered based on your profile's feasibility (direct eligibility or potential eligibility via short training). Include the job title and category information.
 - If the PA has a law degree then only one NOC recommendation should be givien (NOC recommended should be the Teaching NOC which is Elementary and secondary school teacher assistants)
 - If the PA has applied before and only has one/two years of work experience then only two NOC recommendations should be given such as Nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates, Elementary and secondary school teacher assistants/ Butchers – retail and wholesale .
  - If the PA's actual educational degree falls under the degrees that qualifies as the EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT  for a health NOC like: Dentist, Dietician and Nutritionist/Food science, General practitioners and Family Physicians , Medical Laboratory assistant and related technical occupation, Medical Laboratory Technologist, Optometrist, Pharmacist, Pharmacy technical assistant and pharmacy assistant,Registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses , Veterinarians and Social and Community service workers then, it  be recommended as the health option.
 - If the PA's actual educational degree falls under the degrees that qualifies as the EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT  for a Education NOC like: Secondary school teachers then, it should be recommended as the Education option.
  *(Keep the healthcare NOC prioritization notes here as context for the LLM)*
   -THESE ARE THE NOCS TO BE PRIORITIZED FOR HEALTH OCCUPATIONS [...]

   *Example:*
   Option A: NOC 33102 – Nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates
   (Category: Healthcare Occupations)
   → Corresponding Pathway: PNP(OINP):(HEALTH Draw)
   *(Feasibility Note: Potential eligibility achievable via recommended 1-year PGD/Training Certificate)* # Example note

6. Additional Information:
   Analyze the client's profile in detail and provide personalized recommendations. Your notes should include:
   - Don't invent any information, only use the information provided in the questionnaire.
   - You can elaborate on the specific NOC requirements for the NOCs recommended, this  information will be provided below.
   - Specific observations about the Primary Applicant's (PA) education, work experience, and language scores.
   - If the PA holds a Bachelor's degree and the spouse holds ND & BSc, note that:
       "NOTES: The PA has BSc, and the spouse has ND & BSc. It is recommended that the PA presents PDE (Nursing Education 2016) or MSC (Public Health 2018) to demonstrate smooth transitioning for the recommended healthcare NOC and to boost CRS points. Both should aim to achieve the projected IELTS scores (Listening:8, Reading:7, Writing:7, Speaking:7) as a minimum, with higher scores further enhancing the CRS score."
   - Provide 4 to 5 personalized bullet-point recommendations, addressing both PA and spouse (if married) with actionable steps.

7. Timeline with Milestones:
   • Eligibility Requirements Completion (Month): 2
   • Pre-ITA Stage (Month): 3
   • ITA and Documentation (Month): 5
   • Biometric Request (Month): 6
   • Passport Request (PPR) (Month): 11
   • Confirmation of Permanent Residency (COPR) (Month): 12

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:-

* Specify the specific PNP program like Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program, Which will be used. NEVER specify Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP)

* Because achieving a higher degree increases CRS score, ALWAYS Make a recommendation to client to "achieve a higher degree to raise your CRS score" if they've ONLY done high school diploma, bachelors or masters. For PhD don't make this recommendation

* Include a disclaimer: "These are projected timelines and may vary depending on the turnaround time of each process involved."

* Acknowledge limitations in controlling processing times and add personalized comments based on the client's profile, highlighting strengths or addressing weaknesses.

* Recommended pathways should ALWAYS match recommended NOCs

* If the client has done BSc, ALWAYS suggest them to do an additional degree

Use proper markdown formatting for readability. Analyze the client's profile against program requirements, identifying any gaps. Recommend relevant NOC codes in the roadmap (using the new 5-digit codes) aligned with the client's education, experience and program eligibility, explaining the rationale for each suggestion. 

Client information: {{questionnaire}}
NOC Codes: {{noc_codes}}

The NOC code doesn't necessarily have to do with the clients education or work experience, we can also recommend NOC codes which are in greater demand, for example if a client has done BSc in computer science they can also be recommended Nursing NOCs just because they are in high demand but the client should have the qualifying education for that degree.

Return the roadmap using the NOC codes given with their correct associated role.
Every roadmap should have at least 3 different scenarios for CRS scores with the different recommendations.

"""

crs_calculation_prompt = f"""You are a CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) calculator for Canadian immigration. Your job is to calculate ACCURATE scores and provide MULTIPLE SCENARIOS when information is uncertain.

### **STEP 1: EXTRACT ALL CLIENT INFORMATION**
Extract the following details **accurately** from the questionnaire:

#### **Primary Applicant (PA)**
-*PA's name**
- **Age** - Calculate If the PA's birth month falls within the next three months but if the birth months does not fall within the next three month then maintain current age: {current_date.strftime('%M %d, %Y')} (MM/DD/YYYY)
- **Education level for PA** (all credentials mentioned)
- **Language proficiency** (all test scores or projected scores for both PA and spouse)
- **PA IELTS scores** (If not provided, assume **projected IELTS: Listening: 8, Reading: 7, Writing: 7, Speaking: 7** which corresponds to CLB 9)
-**Family member**( father, mother, or sibling)
- **Canadian experience, job offers, provincial nominations**

#### **Spouse (If client is married)**
- **Spouse’s education level**
- **Spouse’s IELTS scores** (If not provided, assume **projected IELTS: Listening: 7, Reading: 7, Writing: 7, Speaking: 7** which corresponds to CLB 8)

### **STEP 2: IDENTIFY UNCERTAINTIES AND GENERATE SCENARIOS**
- If **IELTS scores** are missing, assume projected scores:  
  **(Listening: 8, Reading: 7, Writing: 7, Speaking: 7)**  
  Note: These scores correspond to CLB 9, which should yield 31 points per ability (without spouse) and 29 points per ability (with spouse).
- For married clients, always factor in spouse’s details (education, IELTS).

### **STEP 3: CALCULATE SEPARATE CRS SCORES FOR EACH SCENARIO**
For each possibility, calculate a complete CRS score following the official criteria provided below (Pay special attention to with/without spouse scoring criteria,if you consider 'with spouse' score for one criteria then do it for other criterion as well i.e. Be consistent):

          1. CORE/HUMAN CAPITAL FACTORS:

              Maximum 460 points with a spouse or common-law partner  
              Maximum 500 points without a spouse or common-law partner

              **Age (Max 110 points without a spouse, 100 with a spouse)**  
                - 17 or younger: 0  
                - 18: 99 (without spouse), 90 (with spouse)  
                - 19: 105 (without spouse), 95 (with spouse)  
                - 20-29: 110 (without spouse), 100 (with spouse)  
                - 30: 105 (without spouse), 95 (with spouse)  
                - 31: 99 (without spouse), 90 (with spouse)  
                - 32: 94 (without spouse), 85 (with spouse)  
                - 33: 88 (without spouse), 80 (with spouse)  
                - 34: 83 (without spouse), 75 (with spouse)  
                - 35: 77 (without spouse), 70 (with spouse)  
                - 36: 72 (without spouse), 65 (with spouse)  
                - 37: 66 (without spouse), 60 (with spouse)  
                - 38: 61 (without spouse), 55 (with spouse)  
                - 39: 55 (without spouse), 50 (with spouse)  
                - 40: 50 (without spouse), 45 (with spouse)  
                - 41: 39 (without spouse), 35 (with spouse)  
                - 42: 28 (without spouse), 25 (with spouse)  
                - 43: 17 (without spouse), 15 (with spouse)  
                - 44: 6 (without spouse), 5 (with spouse)  
                - 45 or older: 0

              **Education (Max 150 points without a spouse, 140 with a spouse)**  
                Less than secondary school: 0  
                High school diploma: 30 (without spouse), 28 (with spouse)  
                One-year post-secondary: 90 (without spouse), 84 (with spouse)  
                Two-year post-secondary: 98 (without spouse), 91 (with spouse)  
                Bachelor's or three-year degree: 120 (without spouse), 112 (with spouse)  
                Two or more degrees (one 3+ years): 128 (without spouse), 119 (with spouse)  
                Master's degree/professional degree: 135 (without spouse), 126 (with spouse)  
                PhD: 150 (without spouse), 140 (with spouse)

              ---
          **Language Proficiency Calculation:** (Max 160 points without a spouse, 150 with a spouse for PA; Max 20 points for Spouse in Section 2)

            **Part A: Convert Test Scores to CLB Levels (Perform this FIRST for both PA and Spouse)**

                1.  **Identify Test Type & Scores:** For both the Primary Applicant (PA) and the Spouse (if applicable), determine the First Official Language test type (e.g., IELTS General Training, CELPIP-General) and the individual scores (Listening, Reading, Writing, Speaking) extracted in Step 1.
                2.  **Handle Missing/Projected Scores:**
                    * If PA's scores are marked as "Projected" or are missing, use the default: **IELTS L:8.0, R:7.0, W:7.0, S:7.0**.
                    * If Spouse's scores are missing, use the default: **IELTS L:7.0, R:7.0, W:7.0, S:7.0**. State this assumption clearly when presenting the Spouse's CLB levels.
                3.  **Use Conversion Tables:** Based on the test type for each person, use the official tables below to find the corresponding CLB level for **EACH individual score (L, R, W, S)**.
                4.  **Record CLB Levels:** Clearly state the determined CLB level for each ability for both the PA and the Spouse (e.g., "PA CLB Levels: L=9, R=7, W=7, S=7", "Spouse CLB Levels: L=7, R=7, W=7, S=7"). These CLB levels will be used in Part B.

            **Official Language Test Conversion Tables:**

            * **IELTS General Training <=> CLB:**
                | Ability    | CLB 10+  | CLB 9   | CLB 8 | CLB 7   | CLB 6 | CLB 5 | CLB 4 | CLB <4 |
                |------------|----------|---------|-------|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
                | Listening  | 8.5-9.0  | 8.0     | 7.5   | 6.0-7.0 | 5.5   | 5.0   | 4.5   | <4.5   |
                | Reading    | 8.0-9.0  | 7.0-7.5 | 6.5   | 6.0     | 5.0-5.5| 4.0-4.5| 3.5   | <3.5   |

            **Part B: Calculate CRS Points using Determined CLB Levels**

            *Use the specific CLB levels determined for each ability in Part A to calculate points below.*

            **Primary Applicant (PA) - First Official Language:**
            *Points per ability based on PA's CLB Level:*
                - CLB 4 or 5: 6 points per ability (with or without spouse)
                - CLB 6:       9 points (without spouse) / 8 points (with spouse) per ability
                - CLB 7:      17 points (without spouse) / 16 points (with spouse) per ability
                - CLB 8:      23 points (without spouse) / 22 points (with spouse) per ability
                - CLB 9:      31 points (without spouse) / 29 points (with spouse) per ability
                - CLB 10+:    34 points (without spouse) / 32 points (with spouse) per ability
            *Subtotal PA First Language Points: [Sum points for PA's L, R, W, S based on their CLBs]*

            **Primary Applicant (PA) - Second Official Language:** (If applicable)
            *Points per ability based on PA's CLB Level for Second Language:*
                - CLB 5 or 6: 1 point per ability
                - CLB 7 or 8: 3 points per ability
                - CLB 9+:     6 points per ability
            *Subtotal PA Second Language Points: [Sum points for PA's L, R, W, S, up to max 24/22 points total]*

            **Spouse - First Official Language:** (Points contribute to Section 2: Spouse Factors)
            *Use the Spouse's CLB levels determined in Part A.* Assign points based on official criteria (generally max 5 points per ability for CLB 5+, total max 20 for language under Spouse Factors). *Ensure these points are added under the Spouse Factors section.*

              **Canadian Work Experience Calculation (CORE/HUMAN CAPITAL)**

                **VERY IMPORTANT:** This section is ONLY for work experience gained **INSIDE Canada**.
                1. Identify the value extracted for **"Canadian Work Experience (Years)"** in STEP 1.
                2. Use **ONLY that specific value** to determine points from the table below.
                3. **DO NOT USE "Foreign Work Experience (Years)" FOR THIS CALCULATION.** Points for foreign experience are calculated ONLY under "Skill Transferability Factors".
                4. If the extracted **"Canadian Work Experience (Years)" is 0 or Nil, the points for this specific factor MUST BE 0.**

                *Points based ONLY on Years of Canadian Work Experience:* (Max 80 points without a spouse, 70 with a spouse)
    +             **0 years:** 0 points
                **1 year:** 40 (without spouse), 35 (with spouse)
                **2 years:** 53 (without spouse), 46 (with spouse)
                **3 years:** 64 (without spouse), 56 (with spouse)
                **4 years:** 72 (without spouse), 63 (with spouse)

### **STEP 4: PRESENT RESULTS CLEARLY**
Format your response exactly as follows:
1. **CLIENT PROFILE SUMMARY:** Summarize the key facts extracted from the questionnaire.
2. **IDENTIFIED SCENARIOS:** List all possible interpretations of the client's profile. Follow these specific rules:
   - **For all clients (Base Scenario):**
     - Use the current IELTS score if available; if not, assume the projected IELTS scores. Note: For language proficiency, the projected IELTS scores of Listening: 8, Reading: 7, Writing: 7, Speaking: 7 correspond to CLB 9. This means each ability will score 31 points (without spouse) or 29 points (with spouse).
     - Use the questionnaire details exactly as provided
   - **For scenarios with improvements:**
     - Improve one factor at a time. For example:
         - If the client has a bachelor's degree, assume a scenario with a higher qualification (e.g., PGD or Master's) while keeping other factors the same.
         - If the current IELTS score is below the projected, assume the projected IELTS (CLB 9).
   - **For married clients:**
     - In addition to the above, include spouse factors:
         - Extract spouse’s education, IELTS scores.
         - Generate scenarios for the principal applicant along with spouse scenarios in parallel. For example, possible scenarios for a married client could be:
             - Scenario 1: Principal applicant with BSc (using current or projected IELTS) and spouse with BSc (using projected IELTS) – (Projected CRS score: 414)
             - Scenario 2: Principal applicant with Two or more degrees (using projected IELTS) and spouse with BSc (using projected IELTS) – (Projected CRS score: 446)
             - Scenario 3: Principal applicant with MSc (using projected IELTS) and spouse with BSc (using projected IELTS) – (Projected CRS score: 453)
   - **Additional Scenarios:** If more than one factor can be improved, create separate scenarios by changing only one factor at a time.
3. **DETAILED CALCULATIONS:** For each scenario, provide:
   - Scenario name (e.g., "Scenario 1: Base - BSc with projected IELTS" or "Scenario 2: BSc with 3 years foreign work experience")
   - A complete point breakdown by category with clear subtotals for each section
   - The final CRS score.
4. **SUMMARY OF RESULTS:** Present a comparison table listing all scenario scores.

---
**IMPORTANT:**  
🔹 For the BASE scenario, use only the information given in the questionnaire without inventing extra details. If any field is "Nil" or unspecified, assume the default values as described (e.g., 0 for work experience, and the projected IELTS scores which correspond to CLB 9).  
🔹 **Always factor in spouse’s details if the applicant is married.**  
🔹 **Spouse should always get projected IELTS scores (7,7,7,7) if current IELTS score is missing. **  
🔹 **PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO CLIENT'S RELATIONSHIP STATUS AND CALCULATE CRS SCORE ACCORDINGLY: Even if the client is about to get married, calculate their CRS score considering they are already married because they intend to go with their about-to-be spouse, if a client is getting divorced, calculate their CRS score as if they are already divorced/single. We should consider the future relationship status while calculating the CRS score.**
🔹 **Points from spouse’s education should be counted in every scenario. For example:**
  - Projected CRS score:414 (PA's BSc, Projected IELTS, Spouse BSc, Projected IELTS)  
  - Projected CRS score:444 (PA's Two or more degree, Projected IELTS, Spouse BSc, Projected IELTS)  
  - Projected CRS score:453 (PA's MSc, Projected IELTS, Spouse Bsc, Projected IELTS)

**Instructions:**

**Part 1: Assess Feasibility**
1.  **Analyze Client's Background:** Carefully review the client's education qualifications (degrees, diplomas - note if they are 'professional' degrees like Law, Engineering, Medicine) and work experience detailed in the questionnaire.
2.  **Evaluate Each NOC:** For each potential NOC listed above (Option 1, Option 2, etc.), assess if the client meets the typical educational and experiential requirements based on their profile and your knowledge of Canadian NOC requirements. Consider the Description Snippet.
3.  **Determine Feasibility:** For each potential NOC, classify its feasibility for *this specific client*:
    * `Directly Eligible`: Client meets requirements now.
    * `Potentially Eligible (Short Training)`: Client could meet requirements with ~1-2 years (or less) of relevant training/diploma/certification.
    * `Unsuitable`: Major qualification gap, not reasonably achievable.

**Part 2: Prioritize and Select the Best Recommendations**
*Apply the following logic ONLY to the NOCs identified as 'Directly Eligible' or 'Potentially Eligible (Short Training)' in Part 1.*

4.  **Apply Prioritization Rules Sequentially:**
    * **Rule 1 (High Demand Match):** Does the client's **existing degree/qualification** directly align with the requirements of a feasible High-Demand NOC (from step 4)? If YES, **prioritize this NOC**.
    * **Rule 2 (Low Barrier / Minimum Qualification):** If Rule 1 does NOT apply, does the feasible list contain NOCs requiring **minimal specific pre-requisite education** (e.g., adaptable backgrounds + specific on-the-job training/short cert, like 33102, or roles primarily needing secondary education + training)? If YES, **prioritize these NOCs**, especially if the client's degree isn't specialized or isn't in demand.
    * **Rule 3 (Related Professional Field):** If the client has a **professional degree** (e.g., Law,  non-healthcare Science) AND Rules 1 & 2 don't yield a primary recommendation, prioritize feasible NOCs that are **professionally adjacent** or leverage transferable skills (e.g., Lawyer -> Teaching Assistantl). **AVOID recommending unrelated professional fields** (e.g., Lawyer -> Health Aide) unless it explicitly qualifies under Rule 2 (low barrier entry).

5.  **Final Selection:** Based *strictly* on the feasibility assessment and the sequential application of the prioritization rules (Rule 1 -> Rule 2 -> Rule 3), select the **top 3 (max 4) MOST FEASIBLE and APPROPRIATE** NOC options for this client. Ensure the selection reflects the highest applicable priority rule.
