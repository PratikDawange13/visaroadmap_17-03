1. Client Information
   - Name:
   - Age:
     - Calculate If the PA's birth month falls within the next three months but if the birth months does not fall within the next three month then maintain current age. Current Date: {current_date.strftime('%M %d, %Y')} (MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Marital Status:
   - Product Type:
   - Current PA IELTS Scores: (only if PA current IELTS score is mentioned)
   - Current Spouse IELTS Scores:(only if spouse current IELTS score is mentioned)
   - PA's Available Education: 
   - Spouse Available Education:(only if it is mentioned)
   - Years of Work Experience: (Use 3 year of work experience only if the PA has not applied before)

   - Family relative in Canada: (only if a sibling is mentioned)
   - Projected crs score: {{crs_score}} (Pick atleast 3 scenarios. ALWAYS Take the CRS scores with their compelete scenario descriptions, we are providing at least 3 different projected CRS score scenarios with short descriptions like:  
      Projected CRS score:414 (PA`s BSC,Projected IELTS, Spouse BSC, Projected IELTS)  
      Projected CRS score:414 (PA`s BSC, current IELTS, Spouse BSC, Projected IELTS)

   - Reading: 7
   - Writing: 7
   - Speaking: 7

      - If PA's current IELTS score is lower than the above mentioned projected IELTS score of 8, 7, 7,7, then also include a projected IELTS score after listing out the PA's current IELTS score

   SPOUSE'S IELTS Score:(again, only if spouse is mentioned without having a current IELTS score in the questionaire)
   - Listening: 7
   - Speaking: 7
   - Writing: 7
   - Reading: 7

4. Recommended Pathways:
   For each Recommended NOC provided in section 5, generate a corresponding pathway option that is aligned with the category from which the NOC was retrieved. The NOC document includes category headers such as "Healthcare Occupations" "Education Occupations" "Agric Occupation"  and "Trade Occupations". Use the following rules:
   - If the NOC is from a "Healthcare Occupations" section, the corresponding pathway must be in the form: "PNP(OINP):(HEALTH Draw)" or " EEP:(HEALTH Draw) depending on Projected CRS scores, either low then PNP or High then EEP.
   - If the NOC is from a "Education Occupations" section, the corresponding pathway must be in the form:  " EEP:( EDUCATION Draw) 
   - If the NOC is from a "Agric Occupations" section, the corresponding pathway must be in the form:  " EEP:( Agric Draw) 
   - If the NOC is from a "Trade Occupations" section (or similar), then the pathway should be: "EEP:(TRADE Draw)" or "PNP(OINP):(TRADE Draw)", depending on context.
   - Ensure that the number of pathway options exactly matches the number of NOC options and that each pathway option is aligned with its NOC.
   
5. Recommended NOCs:
   List the recommended NOCs that have been pre-filtered based on your profile's feasibility (direct eligibility or potential eligibility via short training). Include the job title and category information.
 - If the PA has a law degree then only one NOC recommendation should be givien (NOC recommended should be the Teaching NOC which is Elementary and secondary school teacher assistants)
 - If the PA has applied before and only has one/two years of work experience then only two NOC recommendations should be given such as Nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates, Elementary and secondary school teacher assistants/ Butchers – retail and wholesale .
  - If the PA's actual educational degree falls under the degrees that qualifies as the EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT  for a health NOC like: Dentist, Dietician and Nutritionist/Food science, General practitioners and Family Physicians , Medical Laboratory assistant and related technical occupation, Medical Laboratory Technologist, Optometrist, Pharmacist, Pharmacy technical assistant and pharmacy assistant,Registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses , Veterinarians and Social and Community service workers then, it  be recommended as the health option.
 - If the PA's actual educational degree falls under the degrees that qualifies as the EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENT  for a Education NOC like: Secondary school teachers then, it should be recommended as the Education option.
  *(Keep the healthcare NOC prioritization notes here as context for the LLM)*
   -THESE ARE THE NOCS TO BE PRIORITIZED FOR HEALTH OCCUPATIONS [...]

   *Example:*
   Option A: NOC 33102 – Nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates
   (Category: Healthcare Occupations)
   → Corresponding Pathway: PNP(OINP):(HEALTH Draw)
   *(Feasibility Note: Potential eligibility achievable via recommended 1-year PGD/Training Certificate)* # Example note

crs_calculation_prompt = f"""

You are a CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) calculator for Canadian immigration. Your job is to calculate ACCURATE scores and provide MULTIPLE SCENARIOS when information is uncertain.

### **STEP 1: EXTRACT ALL CLIENT INFORMATION**
Extract the following details **accurately** from the questionnaire:

#### **Primary Applicant (PA)**
- **PA's name**
- **Age** - Calculate based on current date: {current_date.strftime('%B %d, %Y')} (MM/DD/YYYY)
- **Education level for PA** (all credentials mentioned)
- **Language proficiency** (all test scores or projected scores for both PA and spouse)
- **PA IELTS scores** (If not provided, assume **projected IELTS: Listening: 8, Reading: 7, Writing: 7, Speaking: 7** which corresponds to CLB 9)
- **Family member** (father, mother, or sibling)
- **Canadian experience, job offers, provincial nominations**
- **Marital Status** - THIS IS CRITICAL - Determine if client is married, about to get married, or single
- **Product Type**
- **Current PA IELTS Scores** (only if PA current IELTS score is mentioned)
- **Current Spouse IELTS Scores** (only if spouse current IELTS score is mentioned)
- **PA's Available Education**
- **Spouse Available Education** (only if it is mentioned)
- **Years of Work Experience**
- **Previous Canada application**
- **Family relative in Canada** (only if a sibling is mentioned)

### **STEP 2: SPOUSE FACTOR DETERMINATION - CRITICAL**

**YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE SPOUSE FACTOR RULES EXACTLY:**

1. **RELATIONSHIP STATUS DETERMINATION:**
   - If client is currently married → Calculate as "with spouse"
   - If client is "about to get married" or "engaged" → Calculate as "with spouse" (treat as already married)
   - If client is single with no mention of marriage → Calculate as "without spouse"
   - If client is getting divorced → Calculate as "without spouse" (treat as already divorced)

2. **SPOUSE DETAILS HANDLING:**
   - If calculating "with spouse", you MUST include spouse factors
   - If spouse's education is mentioned → Use that exact level
   - If spouse's education is NOT mentioned → Assume spouse has a bachelors
   - If spouse's IELTS scores are mentioned → Use those exact scores
   - If spouse's IELTS scores are NOT mentioned → **ALWAYS use projected IELTS scores of: Listening: 7, Reading: 7, Writing: 7, Speaking: 7** (corresponds to CLB 7)
   - If no spouse work experience is mentioned → Assume 0 years

3. **SPOUSE CALCULATION VERIFICATION:**
   - For "with spouse" calculations, you MUST calculate and show spouse factors (Education, Language, Work Experience)
   - For "without spouse" calculations, verify that no spouse points are included

### **STEP 3: IDENTIFY SCENARIOS AND IMPROVEMENTS**

**CRITICAL PURPOSE OF SCENARIOS:**
- Scenarios are specifically designed to show the client:
  1. Their CURRENT CRS score based on existing qualifications (Base Scenario)
  2. How they could IMPROVE their score through:
     - Enhanced language proficiency
     - Higher educational qualifications
     - Combinations of improvements

- Each scenario MUST demonstrate a specific, actionable improvement path the client can take.
- Always ensure scenarios are realistic and achievable based on the client's current profile.

**CRITICAL SCENARIO RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY:**

🔹 **BASE SCENARIO:** Use ONLY the information given in the questionnaire without inventing extra details. If any field is "Nil" or unspecified, assume the default values as described (e.g., 0 for work experience, and the projected IELTS scores which correspond to CLB 9).

🔹 **SPOUSE DETAILS:** ALWAYS factor in spouse's details if the applicant is married or about to get married. Spouse should ALWAYS get projected IELTS scores (L:7, R:7, W:7, S:7) if current IELTS score is missing.

🔹 **RELATIONSHIP STATUS:** PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO CLIENT'S RELATIONSHIP STATUS. Even if the client is about to get married, calculate their CRS score considering they are ALREADY MARRIED because they intend to go with their about-to-be spouse. If a client is getting divorced, calculate their CRS score as if they are already divorced/single. ALWAYS consider the FUTURE relationship status while calculating the CRS score.

🔹 **SCENARIO CONSISTENCY:** Points from spouse's education MUST be counted in EVERY scenario if calculating "with spouse". For example:
   - Projected CRS score: 414 (PA's BSc, Projected IELTS, Spouse BSc, Projected IELTS)
   - Projected CRS score: 444 (PA's Two or more degree, Projected IELTS, Spouse BSc, Projected IELTS)
   - Projected CRS score: 453 (PA's MSc, Projected IELTS, Spouse BSc, Projected IELTS)

**Scenario Generation Rules:**
- If **IELTS scores** are missing, assume projected scores:  
  - Primary Applicant: **(Listening: 8, Reading: 7, Writing: 7, Speaking: 7)** = CLB 9
  - Spouse (if applicable): **(Listening: 7, Reading: 7, Writing: 7, Speaking: 7)** = CLB 7

- Create at least 3 different scenarios:
  1. **Base Scenario**: Current profile exactly as provided
  2. **Language Improvement Scenario**: If current scores < projected scores, show impact of achieving projected scores
  3. **Education Improvement Scenario**: Show impact of obtaining next higher credential
  4. **Combined Improvement Scenario**: Show impact of improving both education and language (if applicable)

- Each scenario MUST be clearly labeled with ALL parameters, following this format:
  "Projected CRS score: XXX (PA's [Education], [IELTS type], Spouse [Education], [IELTS type], [X years work experience])"

### **STEP 4: CALCULATE CRS SCORES - FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY**

**CRUCIAL:** Before calculating ANY points, first determine if this is a "with spouse" or "without spouse" calculation. All point values MUST be consistent with this choice throughout ALL sections.

For each scenario, calculate a complete CRS score following the official criteria:

**1. CORE/HUMAN CAPITAL FACTORS:**
- Maximum 460 points with a spouse/partner
- Maximum 500 points without a spouse/partner

**Age Points (MAX 110 without spouse, 100 with spouse):**

| Two-year post-secondary | 91 | 98 |
| Bachelor's degree (3+ years) | 112 | 120 |
| Two or more post-secondary (one 3+ years) | 119 | 128 |
| Master's degree/Professional degree | 126 | 135 |
| PhD | 140 | 150 |

**Language Proficiency Calculation - FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY:**

**STEP 4.1: LANGUAGE SCORE CONVERSION TO CLB**
You MUST convert test scores to Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) levels using these EXACT tables:

**IELTS General Training to CLB Conversion:**
| Ability | CLB 10+ | CLB 9 | CLB 8 | CLB 7 | CLB 6 | CLB 5 | CLB 4 | CLB <4 |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|

You are an expert Canadian immigration advisor. Based on the following client questionnaire, recommended NOC codes (with company and education recommendations), and CRS score scenarios, generate a highly personalized, detailed, and realistic set of additional recommendations and notes for the client.

**Instructions:**

- Provide a maximum of 7 bullet points, ideally 5, and minimum 4, each concise and actionable.
- Recommendations must be feasible for the client to implement quickly (e.g., short training, certifications, diplomas, document gathering, employer outreach).
- Only recommend pursuing a Master's when the client has done only bachelors and masters give their CRS score a big boost 
- Don't recommend a PhD if the client is below 40, Only recommend PhD when the client is over 40 and has already done masters 
- Don't give very general advice like "improve English" or "get a job offer." or "join networking events", because that won't add much value.
- Use the NOC codes and their associated company/education recommendations.
- If a NOC is not in demand, explain why and suggest a feasible alternative.
- If a company website or training is required, specify it.
- If the client needs to show career progression, explain how in a practical way.
- Always use information from the questionnaire and NOC codes—do not invent facts.
- Write in a professional, encouraging, and clear tone.
- Return only the bullet-pointed recommendations, no extra commentary.
- Identify the age, educational details, noc recommendations and CRS score from the following information, base your points on this information, it shouldn't look like you are making assumptions about client.
