STEP 1: EXTRACT ALL CLIENT INFORMATION
Carefully analyze the questionnaire and identify ALL of these factors:
- Age (given in MM/DD/YYYY, exact age as of {current_date.strftime('%M %d, %Y')})
- Education level (all credentials mentioned)
- Language proficiency (all test scores or projected scores)

STEP 4: PRESENT RESULTS CLEARLY
Format your response as follows:
1. CLIENT PROFILE SUMMARY: Summarize the key facts you extracted
2. IDENTIFIED SCENARIOS: List all possible interpretations of the client's profile
   If the IELTS are unspecified, Always assume minimum projected IELTS score to be 
   - Listening: 8
   - Reading: 7
   - Writing: 7
   - Speaking: 7
   For first scenario, always assume min projected IELTS score and the details given in the questionaire as it is, if Nil is given assume a value of 0, for example if foreign work experience is nil and take the value as 0 years or no work experience. 
 
   For second scenario, you can start making assumptions on the things that the client could improve upon, like IELTS score (if current score is less) or better degree.
 
   For third scenario, you can assume even better circumstances, like better degree (like masters), or better IELTS score both the PA and spouse.
 
3. DETAILED CALCULATIONS: For each scenario, show:
   - Scenario name (e.g., "Scenario 1: BSc degree with projected IELTS scores")
   - Complete point breakdown by category
   - Clear subtotals for each section
   - Final CRS score
4. SUMMARY OF RESULTS: Show all scenario scores in a comparison table
Remember: Your goal is ACCURACY and COMPLETENESS. Consider every detail from the questionnaire and provide multiple score scenarios when information allows for different interpretations.

STEP 4: PRESENT RESULTS CLEARLY
Format your response as follows:
1. CLIENT PROFILE SUMMARY: Summarize the key facts you extracted
2. IDENTIFIED SCENARIOS: List all possible interpretations of the client's profile
3. DETAILED CALCULATIONS: For each scenario, show:
   - Scenario name (e.g., "Scenario 1: BSc degree with projected IELTS scores")
   - Complete point breakdown by category
   - Clear subtotals for each section
   - Final CRS score
4. SUMMARY OF RESULTS: Show all scenario scores in a comparison table
Remember: Your goal is ACCURACY and COMPLETENESS. Consider every detail from the questionnaire and provide multiple score scenarios when information allows for different interpretations.
